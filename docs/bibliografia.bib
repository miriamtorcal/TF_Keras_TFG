   abstract = {Detecting objects from images is a challenging problem in the domain of computer vision and plays a very crucial role for wide range of real-time applications. The ever-increasing growth of deep learning due to availability of large training data and powerful GPUs helped computer vision community to build commercial products and services which were not possible a decade ago. Deep learning architectures especially convolutional neural networks have achieved state-of-the-art performance on worldwide competitions for visual recognition like ILSVRC, PASCAL VOC. Deep learning techniques alleviate the need of human expertise from designing the handcrafted features and automatically learn the features. This resulted into use of deep architectures in many domains like computer vision (image classification, visual recognition) and natural language processing (language modeling, speech recognition). Object detection is one such promising area immensely needed to be used in automated applications like self-driving cars, robotics, drone image analysis. This paper analytically reviews state-of-the-art deep learning techniques based on convolutional neural networks for object detection.},

In this paper, we give a comprehensive survey of recent advances in visual object detection with deep learning. By reviewing a large body of recent related work in literature, we systematically analyze the existing object detection frameworks and organize the survey into three major parts: (i) detection components, (ii) learning strategies, and (iii) applications & benchmarks.

   abstract = {Deep learning is currently widely used in a variety of applications, including computer vision and natural language processing. End devices such as smartphones and IoT sensors are generating data that need to be analyzed in real-time using deep learning or used to train deep learning models. However, deep learning inference and training require substantial computation resources to run quickly. Edge computing, where a fine mesh of compute nodes are placed close to end devices, is a viable way to meet the high computation and low latency requirements of deep learning on edge devices, and also provides additional benefits in terms of privacy, bandwidth efficiency, and scalability. This article aims to provide a comprehensive review of the current state-of-the-art at the intersection of deep learning and edge computing. Specifically, it will provide an overview of applications where deep learning is used at the network edge, discuss various approaches for quickly executing deep learning inference across a combination of end devices, edge servers, and the cloud, and describe methods for training deep learning models across multiple edge devices. It will also discuss open challenges in terms of systems performance, network technologies and management, benchmarks, and privacy. The reader will take away the following concepts from this article: understand scenarios where deep learning at the network edge can be useful, understand common techniques for speeding up deep learning inference and performing distributed training on edge devices, and understand recent trends and opportunities.},

   abstract = {With the development of Internet of Things (IoT), data are increasingly appearing at the edge of a network. Processing tasks at the network edge can effectively solve the problems of personal privacy leakage and server overloading. As a result, it has attracted a great deal of attention. A number of efficient convolutional neural network (CNN) models are proposed to do so. However, since they require much computing and memory resources, none of them can be deployed to such typical edge computing devices as Raspberry Pi 3B+ and 4B+ to meet the real-time requirements of user tasks. Considering that a traditional machine learning method can precisely locate an object with a highly acceptable calculation load, this work reviews state-of-the-art literature and then proposes a CNN with reduced input size for an object detection system that can be deployed in edge computing devices. It splits an object detection task into object positioning and classification. In particular, this work proposes a CNN model with 44 × 44-pixel inputs instead of much more inputs, e.g., 224 × 224-pixel in many existing methods, for edge computing devices with slow memory access and limited computing resources. Its overall performance has been verified via a facial expression detection system realized in Raspberry Pi 3B+ and 4B+. The work makes accurate object detection at the edge possible.},

   abstract = {Due to object detection's close relationship with video analysis and image understanding, it has attracted much research attention in recent years. Traditional object detection methods are built on handcrafted features and shallow trainable architectures. Their performance easily stagnates by constructing complex ensembles that combine multiple low-level image features with high-level context from object detectors and scene classifiers. With the rapid development in deep learning, more powerful tools, which are able to learn semantic, high-level, deeper features, are introduced to address the problems existing in traditional architectures. These models behave differently in network architecture, training strategy, and optimization function. In this paper, we provide a review of deep learning-based object detection frameworks. Our review begins with a brief introduction on the history of deep learning and its representative tool, namely, the convolutional neural network. Then, we focus on typical generic object detection architectures along with some modifications and useful tricks to improve detection performance further. As distinct specific detection tasks exhibit different characteristics, we also briefly survey several specific tasks, including salient object detection, face detection, and pedestrian detection. Experimental analyses are also provided to compare various methods and draw some meaningful conclusions. Finally, several promising directions and tasks are provided to serve as guidelines for future work in both object detection and relevant neural network-based learning systems.},

However, with the explosion of mobile devices and services in the era of Internet-of-Things, it becomes more promising to undertake real-time data processing at the edge of the network in a distributed way. Moreover, in order to reduce the investment of network deployment, media communication in surveillance applications is gradually changing to be wireless. It consequently poses great challenges to detect objects at the edge in a distributed and communication-efficient way. In this article, we propose an edge computing based object detection architecture to achieve distributed and efficient object detection via wireless communications for real-time surveillance applications. We first introduce the proposed architecture as well as its potential benefits, and identify the associated challenges in the implementation of the architecture. Then, a case study is presented to show our preliminary solution, followed by performance evaluation results. Finally, future research directions are pointed out for further studies.},
